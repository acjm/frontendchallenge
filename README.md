#JS

#CSS & IMAGES & ASSETS - I didn't get any asset folder or a figma template. - the focus wasn't 100% on dimensions but rather on the grid system to get closer to the image provided. - same goes with images, i get random images from internet, without teh filter provided
_ we can work on that using css blendmode to get closer to the filter used _

#DATA - data/Cities.js array of objects to mock data - we can also create a node server that serve the same data, we can hit GET:"localhost/api/cities" to get the cities

#COMPONENTS - cards:
we can wrap cards with links to navigate
