# Notes

# CSS & IMAGES & ASSETS

- I didn't get any assets folder or a figma template.
- the focus wasn't 100% on dimensions but rather on the grid system and make it closer to the image provided.
- same goes with images, i got random images from internet, without the filter provided

  _ we can work on that using css blendmode to get closer to the filter used _

# DATA

- data/Cities.js array of objects to mock data
- we can also create a node server that serve the same data, we can hit GET:"localhost/api/cities" to get the cities

# SEO

We could use framework such as NexJs that can handle SSR for better SEO optimsation
